   django deployment notification
   ------------------------------

   A simple utility that will send a notification email to all superusers
   (from current database) that new version of application was deployed.
   All my deployment systems are automated (usually I use Makefiles) so
   typically I use this app by adding the following line after the
   application has been deployed:

   manage.py django-notify -V XYZ -n app.teonite.com -S "Deploy notification"
